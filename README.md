## Installation

### Debian/Ubuntu

On your server:
```sh
# if git isn't installed already
sudo apt-get install git
# cloning the deployment tools in the local directory
git clone https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-deploy
```

Now you 'just have' to install everything: see `./installation/install` for a realistic preview of what that could look like.

You might also want to configure your firewall: see `./setup_firewall`
